<h1>Server Setup:</h1>
  <p>Please follow the instructions that are on <a href="https://codetestgroup.github.io/opensource-tools-setup/">https://codetestgroup.github.io/opensource-tools-setup/</a>! This is so this readme is shorter and you will get a better in-depth explanation on how to set it up!</p>
  <p>NOTE: ServerSide hosts are still in testing and are not released yet! When we do release it will be very buggy! These problems with bugs on the serverside host are out highest concern so we can get a better product out to you.</p>
<h1>How to use:</h1>
  <h2>Self Hosted (on your computer):</h2>
    <p>After you have followed the above instructions to install, download and run the webserver and page files you can just go to <a href="http://localhost/">http://localhost/</a> to see it on your machine that you are hosting it on. The localhost url ONLY works on the same machine that the webserver hosting is running on, if you want to access it from another computer/device you have to get your local IP address of the computer that you are hosting it on. After you have the IP address of the computer that you are hosting it on you can now on another device go to that IP address (eg. 192.168.1.124) and if it is correct you will be able to see it!</p>
  <h2>Github pages:</h2>
    <p>This is the version that you can use without downloading or doing any server setup. This runs on github and you can use it via <a href="https://codetestgroup.github.io/opensource-tools">https://codetestgroup.github.io/opensource-tools</a>! You can use this on any computer, anywhere in the world.</p>
